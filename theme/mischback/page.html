  Make the template to render content configurable from the source file.

  ``Sphinx`` will use the template ``page.html`` (this file!) to render all
  user-provided content.

  When using ``Sphinx`` to drive a website, the author should have some more
  control about the template that will be used.

  This could have been achieved with excessive logic within ``page.html``, but
  instead the author can simply set a (custom) meta variable ``layout`` *in
  the content's source file* as described here:
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html#use-custom-page-metadata-in-html-templates
  and that layout is then used with an ``include`` provided by ``Jinja2``.

  If no ``layout`` is specified, a default layout will be used, which is
  defined in the theme's options, see ``theme.conf``.

  Please note: ``layout`` has to be provided **without** suffix. The required
  ``".html"`` is added here!

  This technique mimics how ``Jekyll`` allows control about the layout, or
  more precisely the template, using the source file's *frontmatter*, see
  https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/#usage .
