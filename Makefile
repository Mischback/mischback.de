# ### RECIPES

# Run ``sphinx`` to create the actual release files
build/sphinx : requirements/build-sphinx.txt
	$(TOX_CMD) -e build-sphinx
.PHONY : build/sphinx

# Run ``pre-commit``
#
# This is the actual recipe that runs ``pre-commit``. It is used by other
# recipes, that will set the required ``pre-commit_id`` and
# ``pre-commit_files`` variables.

# (Re-) Generate the requirements files using pip-tools (``pip-compile``)
#
# ``pip-compile`` is run through a ``tox`` environment. The actual command is
# included in ``tox``'s configuration in ``pyproject.toml``. That's why that
# file is an additional prerequisite. This may lead to additional
# regenerations, but these will most likely not affect the generated files.
